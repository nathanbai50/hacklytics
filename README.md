# Pushup Pal 💪

An intelligent iOS fitness application built to analyze pushup form and generate dynamic coaching targets. Pushup Pal tracks depth and body alignment in real time, using a Python-powered AI backend to actively push users toward new rep and score milestones based on their performance history.

## Features

- **Real-Time Form Analysis** — Tracks elbow depth and body alignment on every rep, flagging poor form as it happens
- **AI-Generated Goals** — A Python backend analyzes your last 5 sets and generates personalized rep and score targets that level up as you improve
- **Dynamic Progress Tracking** — Visual progress bars show how close you are to hitting your current rep and score goals
- **Workout History** — Browse and review all past sets with per-rep breakdowns and coaching takeaways
- **Firebase Backend** — Authentication, Firestore persistence, and live snapshot listeners keep data synced in real time

## How It Works

1. **Record a Set** — The app uses your camera to track your pushup reps in real time
2. **Analyze Form** — Each rep is scored based on elbow depth (target: ≤ 90°) and body alignment (target: 180°)
3. **Save & Sync** — Completed sets are saved to Firestore and your total set count is updated automatically
4. **AI Coaching** — After each set, the Python backend provides personalized feedback + reviews your recent history and either maintains your current goals or levels them up if you've hit your targets
5. **Track Progress** — Your profile shows live progress bars toward your current rep and score goals alongside your full workout history

## AI Goal Logic

Goals are generated by sending the following data to the Python backend after each set:

- Total lifetime sets completed
- Scores and rep counts from the last 5 sets
- Average pushup depth across recent reps
- Coaching takeaways from recent sets

The backend returns a goal message, a rep target, and a score target. Goals only level up once the user has **met or exceeded** their current targets, ensuring progression feels earned.
